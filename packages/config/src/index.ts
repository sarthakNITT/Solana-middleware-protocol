    {
        q: "What is Sendra?",
        a: "Sendra is a transaction reliability layer for Solana. It intercepts your transactions before they hit the network, simulates them, optimizes fees, selects the fastest RPC, and handles retries automatically — ensuring every transaction lands.",
    },
    {
        q: "How does Sendra integrate with my existing app?",
        a: "Sendra provides a drop-in SDK. Replace your existing sendTransaction call with sendWithReliability — no infrastructure changes, no new dependencies, no migration. It works with any Solana SDK.",
    },
    {
        q: "How is Sendra different from standard RPC providers?",
        a: "Standard RPCs are just pipes — they send your transaction and hope it lands. Sendra adds an intelligent execution layer: pre-flight simulation, dynamic fee optimization, multi-node routing, and automatic retry with exponential backoff.",
    },
    {
        q: "Does Sendra modify my transaction?",
        a: "Sendra only adjusts the compute unit price (priority fee) based on real-time network conditions. Your transaction instructions, accounts, and logic remain completely untouched.",
    },
    {
        q: "What happens when a transaction fails?",
        a: "Sendra automatically retries with a fresh RPC route and recalculated fees. It uses exponential backoff and intelligent node switching to maximize the chance of confirmation, up to your configured retry limit.",
    },
    {
        q: "What Solana programs does Sendra support?",
        a: "Sendra is program-agnostic. It works with any Solana program — token transfers, DeFi swaps, NFT mints, governance votes, or custom programs. If it's a Solana transaction, Sendra can handle it.",
    },
    {
        q: "Is Sendra open source?",
        a: "Yes. Sendra's SDK and core packages are fully open source. You can inspect every line of code, contribute, or fork it for your own use.",
    },
